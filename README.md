## Note:
   The working APIs are in the following pages (form bottm sheet edit education, edit projects, edit skills and edit social with get API only). And the API to get all users is applyed but not working IDK         whey. And lastly, the only Auth api applyed is the regiteration. You can use the app by setting the token manually in global file.
